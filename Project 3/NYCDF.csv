do you ever feel like you're not taking advantage of NYC?,"I've lived here nearly 3 years and I find myself being a bit more socially withdrawn (personal problem probably) and doing less on the weekends and more lazing about/revisiting favorite spots.

It's giving me a lot of guilt, like I'm not ""doing NYC right"" by being a hypebeast in the LES or going to glorious events and summer parties every weekend.

is this just the natural way of things once you've been here for a while or do i just need a therapist lol",nyc

Cuomo Urges MTA to Crack Down on Homeless People in NYC Subways,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-12/cuomo-urges-mta-to-crack-down-on-homeless-people-in-nyc-subways?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-12/cuomo-urges-mta-to-crack-down-on-homeless-people-in-nyc-subways?srnd=premium)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Homeless subway population is up 23% this year, governor says**              
* **Advocates say Cuomo worsened the problem by cutting programs**              

&amp;#x200B;

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state transit agency must rid city subways of a growing homeless population.

In a letter sent Friday to the [Metropolitan Transportation Authority](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13462Z:US)’s  board of directors, Cuomo said they should confront the issue as part  of a reorganization plan the state legislature required last month. The  MTA and the city police department have to stop pointing at each other  to avoid responsibility, he said.

About 2,200 homeless persons are living in the subways this  year, a 23% increase over 2018, Cuomo said in the letter. Homeless  persons delayed trains on 659 occasions last year, by walking on tracks  or engaging in other disruptive conduct, he wrote.

“I’ve never seen it this bad,” said Cuomo, a Democrat. “I’ve never seen it as a year-round phenomenon. ”

In  pushing the MTA, Cuomo described himself as an expert in homelessness  policy even before he served as U.S. Secretary of Housing in former  President Bill Clinton’s administration.

In his nine years as governor, Cuomo [has been attacked](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-15/de-blasio-s-quest-for-rent-control-power-faces-albany-roadblocks) by [advocates for tenants](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-08-23/gaffe-aside-n-y-s-cuomo-rides-high-in-his-bid-for-re-election)  and the homeless who say he worsened the problem by failing to support  laws that would prevent deregulation of rent-stabilized housing. Such  attacks became muted this year after [he agreed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-14/n-y-adopts-sweeping-tenant-protections-on-rents-and-evictions) to sign a [package of sweeping tenant protections](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-15/de-blasio-s-quest-for-rent-control-power-faces-albany-roadblocks) approved by both the state [Senate](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/32663Z:US) and Assembly, which Democrats control for the first time in decades.

The homeless population began to spike in 2011, after the  governor eliminated state aid for rent subsidies to tenants at risk of  eviction, according to Kenneth Schaeffer, a lawyer for the Metropolitan  Council On Housing, a tenant advocacy group.

“Governor Cuomo’s  failure to push for stronger rent laws has directly contributed to  increased homelessness,” Schaeffer wrote in a 2016 article published on  the council’s website, titled “Cuomo’s Homelessness Hypocrisy.”

Questions about the 5 train?,"So even though I was born in NYC and have lived here my entire life, I don't take the subways often at all. I know I'm gonna sound like a snob so judge me if you want but the subway has always scared me. I'm a relatively young girl, and I look quite a bit younger than I actually am, and it seems as though anytime I go anywhere by myself I get approached by weird/creepy people (particularly men) and it really freaks me out. Sometimes they just follow me, sometimes they're just pervs, sometimes they ask me for money or ask me to buy them something, but they always tend to walk with me/follow me around. My dad said this never happens to him (getting followed and approached for money) when he goes places. IDK what it is about me that attracts them. Maybe I look anxious/out of place. IDK. But when there is someone who seems ""off"",  even if they're not bothering me, I get really anxious because I guess I look like an easy target given how many times I've been approached before. So I really prefer forms of transportation like buses, where the driver is right there and can control a situation, or when you can easily get off if you need to. 

Now, I'm starting a new job where I need to get to the Bronx. I live on the Upper East Side, and the best train for me to take is the 5. I will be taking it around 7:00-8:00 AM and 4:30-5:30 PM. Can anyone just give me a general overview of what that train is like? Are there a lot of shady/creepy seeming people there? Is it usually relatively crowded so there are other people so I'll never be alone with another person? My dad doesn't seem to know what I'm talking about/what my problem is, but my mom and my sister understand my anxiety. So maybe it'd be helpful if some women could talk about their experience with that train?",nyc

How do I record my downstairs neighbors insanely intrusive music to prove to my landlord they're loud?,"TL;DR my downstairs neighbors music is so incredibly loud and intrusive and we can't get it to stop. We're miserable. I've recorded it on my iphone but want to know if there's a better way to capture it to convey to my landlord how bad the bass gets.

Apologies for the long post. But this has been a saga and I really need solid advice on how to handle this. I'm at my wits end and am considering moving out of my place to keep my sanity.

My SO and I moved into an apartment about two months ago in Queens. We love it except for the downstairs neighbor. Let's call them M. We quickly learned they have an insanely loud speaker system  that M liked to  blast at at all hours. We first were introduced to it by their Alexa talking through the speakers and it shaking the furniture in our living room. That's how loud it is.  Then the insanely loud music started.

&amp;#x200B;

Wanting to be a good neighbor I went down and knocked on their door the first night we realized we wouldn't be able to sleep (our bedroom is on the other side of the apt and it was vibrating our bed). This was a Friday night around 11:30 pm. I had met both roommates who lived there a few days earlier in the hallway and made sure I introduced myself as the new upstairs neighbor so I felt ok with going to their door to ask to turn it down. A stranger answered and, not knowing it was if it was a third roommate, I asked them to turn the music down because it was really loud. Calm. Direct. Cordial. The person gave me a half nod and shut the door. Forty-five minutes later the music was still blasting and I was obviously more annoyed. I went down again and knocked louder (because it took them awhile to hear my first knock due to the  music volume) and M answered. I was obviously annoyed but wanted to remain cordial and direct. I told them that the music was way too loud and we could feel the vibrations all the way in our room and that I had already come down once to ask if they could turn it down. M responded (paraphrasing): ""Well you didn't tell ME it was loud. It's Friday night so I don't know what you want me to do. I work damn hard and I'm trying to relax."" Ok. I think its completely acceptable to play some music on Friday nights and I realize that living in NYC requires having a higher-than-normal tolerance for noise but this was WAY beyond that. I responded ""I understand but the bass vibrates our entire apartment. I work damn hard too and I'd rather come directly to you with this than complain to the landlord"" Obviously this was not the right foot I was hoping to get off on with my new neighbors but there we were. M shrugged this off and said they would turn the bass down. Didn't happen. That's when I knew it was going to be an issue.

Ever since, its been 2-3 nights a week of music. 8 pm on Tuesday? check. 3 am on Sunday? check. What's worse is M treats the living room like a karaoke bar, screaming the lyrics to every song. In the following weeks I went down three more times to ask them to turn it down (each time a stranger answered the door). I tried talking to M's roommate when I realized knocking on the door wasn't working. I caught the roommate in the hallway about a week after the first incident and explained the situation. The roommate was very nice and understanding, said they hadn't been at the apt during the nights in question but understood how loud noise could be a disruption. I asked for their phone number so I could text them if the music was too loud (I said he could do the same if we were loud, walked too loud across the floor, etc).

After two different loud nights and two text messages later (not to mention the one clearly audible argument between M and the roommate about the music), the roommate texted me and said that they unfortunately couldn't control M but that he was sorry but agreed that the music was too loud.

By this point I had furiously googled how to deal with noisy neighbors with very little success (""play music just as loud! That'll show 'em!"" is not helpful advice, internet) We were miserable. I felt awful when my SO's family came to stay with us, excited to see our new place but we had to insist they stay in our bedroom and that they bring ear plugs/headphones to block out the music. That night M blasted music till till 3 am as we sat up awake trying to put on a brave face, nervously trying to laugh the whole thing off with my SOs parents.

I had hesitated reaching out to the landlord because I worried it would just escalate the situation and not sure how much authority the landlord has in the situation. I finally broke 2.5 weeks ago and reached out the landlord and tried to convey the severity of the noise as best as possible. The landlord responded that they would talk to M. In the weeks since, the frequency of the music has dropped a bit (1-2 nights a week) and we have have been able to block out some noise sometimes by turning on our A/C and wearing headphones (thank god for brown noise) But the bass is so hard to block out. I feel my floor vibrating from M's music as I write this.

I feel like I have PTSD at this point. Any loud bump or noise in our old building makes my stomach drop and my heart rate shoot up. I honestly feel dread and think ""Is it starting up again?"" Naturally, I'm seething right now typing these words with their shitty top-40 music rumbling underneath me.

Early on I came across a piece of advice that said you should record the noisy neighbor and note the time and frequency to send to your landlord. I have done this diligently ever since, recording the sound in my living room. I mentioned I had recordings in my email to the landlord but they didn't say they wanted to hear them.  However, hearing the playback of these recordings from my iphone doesn't capture the intrusiveness of the music nor the intensity of the bass.

So here's my question reddit: how do I capture audio that will adequately convey to my landlord how bad this situation is? Do I need a better audio recorder? How should I approach my landlord a second time (talking to M is out of the question, given I've tried over half a dozen times)  Also, is there any other way to get this to stop? How should I prepare if I potentially need to take legal action (witholding my rent to get the noise to stop or breaking my lease entirely)?

Any practical advice is welcome, Reddit.. We're really feeling more and more hopeless every day.",nyc

Beware of Empire NYC (331 W 39th Street),"If you’re looking for a job in the NYC area, beware of Empire 

I had seen an IT position on LinkedIn that looked to be right up my alley, so I sent my resume. 

They advertised that they had just expanded to NYC and was looking a great group of people with a good personality and sense of humor to join the team. Great - I’m kind of funny and have a good personality. 

Fast forward a couple of days and I get an email from “Pamela Alvarado - HR Assistant” that said:

“Hey Pete!

 

My name is Pamela, and I'm the HR assistant here at Empire NYC. Thank you for sending over your resume! We just expanded to the New York area and are excited about adding some new talent to our team!

 

The HR management team asked me to reach out because at this point they would like to invite you in for more of an interview to come to sit down with us! We’ve already begun interviewing with other top candidates, but we still have appointments left for tomorrow between 10:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. The interview itself will be casual. We want to meet you, give an outline of the role and then narrow down to a handful of candidates to invite back for a final interview, more in depth. You can expect to be in and out within around 35 min of arriving.

 

The interview is going to be held at our headquarters on 331 West 39th Street, New York, NY, 10018. Please respond back with a couple times that will work for you and I'll get back to you with the time and send an email with further instructions. “

This is where my suspicions started. I had been contacted by another “marketing” company who had sent me a very similar email - but a different address.  The signature had a name and email address...but no phone number. But seeing that I need a job, I accepted and had an interview for today. 

I got a confirmation email for our interview, and it said that if I got lost or was running late, to give them a call - again no phone number. I tried searching for their company for social media presence and found just their website [empire-nyc.net](empire-nyc.net). It looked alright, but there is no specific information listed for their “team” page or what they actually do. 

I did a Google search of the address and it shows that a place called Production Haus was at that address, not a place called Empire NYC. Okay. 

I get there and it is indeed Production Haus. The receptionist asked me which company I was there for and told her. Another red flag. There was about 50 other people there for this casual meet and greet. And I start seeing groups of people leave with little tables - like the people you see in the subways with pamphlets and such. 

The reception area was pretty cool - good music was playing and it was pretty start-up looking. They had me fill out another application and sit and wait. 

As I’m looking around, I see other people with these looks of “oh my god, what the hell am I doing here” on their faces. 

I sat and then was greeted by “Mo” - the CEO. Not HR. 

We went back to his “office” (which looked nothing like the reception area - it seemed like a basement) and had a 5 minute interview. He basically told me that they do marketing for “big companies” (didn’t give any examples) and it’s face-to-face... basically a telemarketer without the phone. 

His goal was to open 3 more offices this year (mind you, the New York office was a “new expansion” but he never said where they expanded to or where these other three offices would be). He wants a team of people to market on the streets and after we learn that he wants to select a corporate trainer. 

That is NOT what I even applied for. 

I think my interview was cut short because I saw right through this scam after being there. I told him that everything so far seemed like information I got from a scam company. 

The color on his face drained and he said that he was meeting with “1,000 people today.” And after the interviews they would send a select few of us emails to invite us back tomorrow. 

Needless to say, I didn’t get invited back. 

I went into today’s interview 98% sure this wasn’t legit. I did not dress up or make an attempt to wow these people. I basically agreed to go 1) I didn’t have anything else to do today and 2) to report back here. 

If you’re contacted by Empire or Production Haus, don’t even bother. 

The only perk to today was that Jollibee was right around the corner, so I did get to enjoy that.",nyc

"Nonprofits in NY, social impact, women of color / minorities?","Hello!!

I am a college student from California and I've never been to NY, but I will be studying in NYC in the fall for school. In the program I'm in, we are supposed to get an internship to work at 4 days a week, and I'm just here to see if anyone could help me find organizations that focus on using design for social impact. I'm a Product Design student so I want to develop my design skills, but I also want to work at a place that focuses on social issues (housing justice, immigration, minority representation, etc). I just need to be pointed in the right direction as to where to look!

The program is designed so that I do not need to be paid for the internship opportunity, and that's why I think it will be great to work with a nonprofit since there will be no financial pressure on the org!

Let me know what resources you have/what places fit what I'm trying to do in the fall! Also please feel free to ask clarifying questions because I'm typing this up pretty quick haha - thank you so much!!",nyc

This is a terrible city and country,"What kind of backwards ass city is this? I just moved here from Toronto for work and I will be paying 34.54% effective tax rate for the year. I am registering for health care plans offered by my work and have had no idea what a deductible, co-pay, co-insurance, out of pocket max, premiums, etc. are. I researched these things and have just found out that for an EPO, my deductible is $3,500. This means that before I even see a doctor, I need to pay up to $3,500 before they cover anything. So if my doctor charges $600 for a check up I will pay $600. And then because of the nature of EPOs I can only see doctors who are ""in network"" because presumably these in network offices have negotiated rates with the insurance to siphon as much money out of you as possible.

BQE kosciuszko bridge traffic caused by merges + low speed limit,"I’ve seen it time and time again, no reason to be waiting 10-20 minutes to cross that bridge after 1:30pm. The merges can cause traffic but the biggest issue is that after the merge (North bound to LIE) from the underpass on the bridge itself, a speed limit of 45 does not allow cars to clear the merge fast enough and this causes long queues. After this last merge I see the TLC drivers lumber at 35-45 and space out to 3-4 car lengths. This isn’t fast enough for people to clear that merge. If there was a temporary speed limit of say 60 after that merge it would be ideal. 

South bound same issue, from Astoria all the way down 278 to the bridge people slam on the brakes soon as they see the left turn. Slow ass speed limits and brake hogs are the major
cause of this awful traffic. The merges are a huge factor as well but the rest can be remedied.",nyc

Tenant refusing to pay $100 increase to rent.,"Update: I have no intentions on evicting him unless he doesn't agree to the new lease and security deposit which I haven't increased since 7 years ago. He asked for a 2 year lease with a 2.5% increase but it turns out it's backfiring on him with a 1 year lease, 4.55% increase and an increase of $550 from the $1650 deposit. Since he wants to do this the correct way, then we will. 

I'm still being more than generous by not making him pay what others charge in the area. If he refuses, the price will then go up for the next tenant. Not by a substantial amount, however. 

---

I own a home where rent is around $2500 for 2 bedrooms in Queens. I have been charging my tenant $2100/m without a lease for the last two years because the guy said he couldn't afford to pay more than that plus he's been a tenant for 7+ years. I've decided that I should bring up the rent by at most $200 because rent is increasing in the area and that I'm charging him way too little. I told him about the rent increase and he said that it isn't fair for me to come out of nowhere and increase the rent by that much and asked that I only do $100. I agreed. Then a week later he comes to me and says that he'll only give me $52 and that he wants a lease for 2 years from now on because NYC law states that ""all nyc apartments can increase rent by 2.5% for 2 year leases and 1.5% for a 1 year lease"".  - only applies to rent stabilised, not rent controlled.

I've spoken to my lawyer and we've made a lease, I'm in the good, pricing it at what my tenant and I originally agreed upon but with a one year lease instead of two.",nyc

Do elementary/middle school/high school students have access to free MTA cards?,"I run a extracurricular program and one of the students mentioned ducking under the gates to take the subway. 

I would prefer if he didn't do this. I'm wondering if there's any way he can apply for a MTA card. 

My gut feeling is that students, especially low-income students, should have a way to access these cards.",nyc

Need help resolving electricity issue with landlord. Is it ConEd or the building? Can I challenge a rent increase?,"As of 4th of July, my rent stabilized apartment building in Ridgewood, Queens has been surging power. The AC won't stay on for more than a few seconds without shutting off and then turning back on after several minutes. Several appliances in the apartment surge as well, including the fridge, and my receiver. 

&amp;#x200B;

My building manager claims that this is a city issue and there's nothing she can do about it. An electrician came to the building today and said the power is lower than usual but still within limits (193). I have an unsigned lease renewal and I don't know if I have a right to challenge the landlord on rent increase since this is ""out of their control"" but seriously negatively impacting my living situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. My work benefits includes access to MetLife Legal Services and I don't know if I have any legal leverage to combat an increase in rent with these power issues.

"Given the cost of living in NYC, engineering ( traditional not software) salaries are very low","Starting and even experienced salaries are really bad compared to the cost of living and the cap is also low compared to the capital budgets the projects are funded with. The starting salaries for EE , ME and civil float between 55 and 65 ( high end) and you'd be lucky to get anything that pays over 100k 7-8 years later. With about 10 years of exp, I have been interviewing and it infuriates me that I would have to double my responsibility and commute time for just a 15% raise and no Im not making the big bucks to begin with. These numbers are from very popular and reputable engineering firms here in nyc.

Compare this with LCOL ( low cost of living) areas and the numbers are pretty much the same except a engineer making 90k in Kansas or Dallas gets a lot more for that than someone living in queens. Manhattan is out of the question.

&amp;#x200B;

All other industries seem to have their salaries adjusted for cost of living expenses but not traditional engineering. Look at the job posts for the MTA or other city agencies, the pay is just shit for what they want. The city jobs in other parts of the country pay pretty well when taking into account the cost of living there. With such high taxes going to OT in other city agencies, wouldnt it make sense to pay engineers well? Engineers seem to be taken for granted in new york.

I have to mention that a 120k or less salary for a P.E ( professional engineer) is not adequate at all. Anyone here actually break that ceiling?",nyc

Many rooftop restaurants or lounges are fairly upscale- they have a kind of business casual vibe, and I'm looking for somewhere more casual and laid back than that. I'm a tshirt and jeans kind of person, so I'd stand out like a sore thumb if I went to an upscale business casual type of place.

I’ve consented going a few times but I don’t really get the appeal. I’ve tried the sauna at the gym a few times and it didn’t really do anything for me. Are they worth the money?",nyc
Turning right with a pedestrian somewhere in the crosswalk,"Ok, I know the anti-car people will want to jump on this. I'm not asking for all that. I just wanted to share an experience and ask for thoughts. 

I was turning right from Queens Blvd onto a side street. Someone had entered the crosswalk but I had PLENTY of time to turn. I specifically thought about that before turning, determining how long it would take them. I decided I had time, which I did. They didn't have to stop or slow down.

A cop, who was already standing outside of his car, waved me over. I honestly didn't know what I did. I think he was just waiting for someone to do that and turn. I ended up with a summons that I'm going to try and fight. 

Afterwards on my way home, I tried to wait until absolutely no one was in the crosswalks when turning right. It was nearly impossible; there are pedestrians in the crosswalk until the last second, which of course, is understandable.

Is it doable? Do you think I can fight it? I have dashcam footage of the pedestrian not super close to me so I'm hoping that works.",nyc

Tishman Auditorium, NYC

Powerful surveillance software for everyday use tune in your calls, text messages, real-time GPS location or encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp. These capabilities can afford dramatic powers and control over an individual’s everyday life. Surveillance apps for private purposes are routinely linked to identity theft, physical injuries, sexual harassment, extortion and child abuse, among others.

Malicious software which with an aim to monitor and control a targeted person is widely available on the internet for affordable prices. Some are marketed as ways for employers to monitor the movements of their workers, or for parents to check electronically on the whereabouts of their children. Others promise to help you to reveal infidelity.

How concerned should you really be and how can you safeguard yourself against an attack? Why is the spyware still sludging through the market despite being used for blatantly illegal purposes? Where do the tech community, the police, and the policymakers stand on the issue of surveillance for private purposes?

A cybersecurity specialist, Eva Galperin of Electronic Frontier Foundation, is the speaker at this public event, addressing the concerns through the prism of cybersecurity, criminology, and socio-economics.

One of my fav memories was in the 7th grade, during after school jazz band, we had a 15 min break during rehearsal we were playing monkey in the middle and all of a sudden one of my best guy friends picked me up and gave me a piggy back ride and ran around the whole school, i remember it being such a thrill! we were definitely gonna get in so much trouble afterward but one of the security guards loved me and let us off the hook, he was the goat.

Is it a good idea to move to Brooklyn nowadays?,"Howdy

&amp;#x200B;

Currently living in Northern Florida, moved in to the States 3 years ago, i was born in Bronx but lived outside of the US till 2016, so papers/documents ain't an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

However things are rather slow/lacking of opportunities around this city, i really like it but it has a rural small city mindset, a cousin of mine suggested the idea of moving in with him in Brooklyn, and all that comes to my mind is literally GTA IV's beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly ain't much of an outgoer and the commute in NY seems like a nightmare but there seems to be more opportunities for work, but is it really worth it in the end? all i see is youtubers with like 7 roomates to share a house.

I remember the subways being too cold in Manhattan.,"So, I was living in Manhattan in 2001 in the middle of the summer. It was sweltering hot outside but when I went down to use the subway, which was often, you would be blasted with cold air from the aircon on the trains. I'm talking really cold.

You might think that would be nice when it is hot outside, but the extreme change in temperature, several instances per day, would make me feel nauseous. Was this just me?

If so, is it still the same way now?

I'm curious as I might be going back there soon.

EDIT:

Now I've had my memory jogged a little, I remember the platforms themselves were roasting hot.  Then stepping onto a train was freezing.  That sudden change in temperature within seconds is what really messed me up.  It was like stepping directly out of an oven into a freezer.  It really made me feel unwell.",nyc

And this is partly because I'm an idiot who never paid attention to the bill up until very recently. I noticed that I've been paying ""Tolls by Mail"" rate for Throgs Neck Bridge which is $9.50, instead of ""EZ-PASS"" rate of $6.12. It's only about $3 difference but I visit NJ to see my family about once a month, so this really adds up. I calculated how much extra I paid in the last 6 months, and it was about $40. Since I never noticed this issue for about 5 years, so I think I wasted about $200...😭

"Mayor de Blasio, NYPD announce strategies to support NYC citywide bicycle safety passage plan","In our efforts to continue providing a safe passage for cyclists and reduce bicycle-related injuries and fatalities, NYPD is coordinating a citywide traffic initiative focused on preventing hazardous parking and moving infractions that interfere with the safe passage of cyclists.  The initiative will commence on Monday, July 1, 2019 through Sunday, July 21, 2019. 

This initiative will be conducted on all tours with participation from all enforcement personnel with particular attention to the following infractions committed by vehicle operators:

· All Vision Zero &amp; hazardous parking and moving violations, especially:

o Speeding, Red Light, Fail to Yield to Pedestrian/Bicyclists and Cellphone/Texting (distracted driving).

o Vehicles that are parked in, or otherwise obstructing a bicycle lane (No Standing).

o Double Parking

· Traffic Enforcement Agents  will enforce the above hazardous parking violations throughout the city commencing on July 1, 2019 through July 21, 2019

· All Traffic Safety Personnel in all 77 precincts will participate and enforce the above Vision Zero and hazardous parking and moving violations commencing on July 8, 2019 through July 21, 2019. 

· Patrol Supervisors will respond to a scene of a bicyclist/pedestrian struck in order to conduct a thorough investigation on whether Administrative Code 19-190, “Right of Way” law has been violated.

· Auxiliary Officers will conduct high visibility education outreach educating drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians on safer bicycle, vehicle and pedestrian tips to reduce injuries and fatalities. 

“We are seeing a dangerous surge in cyclist deaths on our streets, and we are taking action. I have directed the NYPD to immediately launch a major enforcement action that will encompass every precinct and crack down on dangerous driving behavior like parking in bike lanes. At the same time, I have charged the Department of Transportation with developing a new cyclist safety plan to make biking in our city safer. No loss of life on our streets is acceptable. Last year was the safest year on record—and we have to keep pushing the envelope and increasing our efforts until we achieve Vision Zero.”

[Help] My MetroCard got damaged.

I am concerned that if I do that I won't get my money back. I'm worried that they'll think I'm lying because I didnt get the receipt from the machine. I've never gotten the receipt from the machine. I never felt a need to. What's worse is I paid with cash. I got in the habit of paying with cash because when I first came to New York almost all of the machines wouldn't accept credit card.

[Question] Can I find a rental in September at all?,"Hi everyone,I recently accepted a job in New York, and now I am in the process of looking for housing. I have never lived in New York before, so I'd love to know if it is possible to sign a lease in September at all. The reason for my question is as followed:

* I have found a few places in my price range, but my top choice involves a lease for a duplex that will end in two months. I am just worried that if I take that one and end up not finding people to replace those moving out  (to keep that lease), it might difficult to find another place to jump to.
* A side questions: Are there many people looking for a place in September, because that will affect my decision as well?

I am from Philly, and originally an international student, so pardon me if there is a common sense solution that I am overlooking.Thank you so much.",nyc

Flood from upstairs apartment,"I own a coop apartment and my mom lives there full time. My upstairs neighbor recently broke (accidentally) their giant aquarium and tons of water poured down into our apartment. My 90 year old mom didn't know what to do and asked the superintendent for help. The super who happened to be good friends w/ the upstairs neighbor simply told her to wait for the ceiling to dry and he will come and paint it over. Problem is, couple of weeks went by and the rooms now smell strongly of mold. I didn't know about this until today because I just came back from a vacation abroad.  I am going to call a water damage company first thing tomorrow. However I think my upstairs neighbor should foot the bill. They said they couldn't afford any major repair work, but they (as well as myself and every coop tenants are all required to) have coop insurance. They didn't want to give us the insurance info because it would cause their rates to go up.  What should I do?  Should I try to force them to give me their insurance info or do I have to call my own insurance company? Should I foot the bills myself then sue them? This is not some mysterious leak from hidden pipes. This is definitely due to their negligence.  I don't know how coop insurance usually works because I have never filed any claims before and definitely never had to deal with other neighbor's insurance. Please help with advice.",nyc

Batshit Construction in Sunset Park,"Round the clock, loud construction has been going on in the median of 4th Ave between 45th and 53rd for MONTHS. 5am? Jackhammer. 11pm? Jackhammer.

The project is completely unlisted. The city's public works listing, MTAs ongoing works page, they have nothing. Calling 311 has netted me lots of sympathy, but no action or info.

Tip - Bringing your own cable modem from Time Warner to Optimum,"I hope this helps someone, because it wasn't fun trying to figure it out.

I recently moved from Manhattan to Brooklyn. That meant I had to switch service from TWC to Optimum (no Fios in my building). I own my own cable modem.

The Optimum technician came out, checked my line, tested it with Optimum router/modem, everything working. But when he attached my cable modem, it would light up but not fully connect to the network. He couldn't figure out why, so he asked me to reschedule or cancel the appointment.

After a night of Googling, the answer was: 1) we don't control our cable modems' firmware, the cable companies do, 2) TWC uses IPV6, 3) Optimum uses IPV4 and 4) a cable modem that's running IPV6 cannot work on Optimum's IPV4. The fix was to do a factory reset of my cable modem and then after attaching it to the coax cable, it updated onto Optimum's IPV4 firmware.

Of course, due to Optimum's ""bureaucrazy"" another technician had to come out to ""sign off"" on the installation. All other cable internet services have never required an in-person visit... separate post.

In the course of this, I talked to multiple customer support reps, telephone technicians and in person technicians - and except for 1 manager, they didn't know about the IPV6-&gt;IPV4 issue. Telling when the customer has more technical knowledge than the employees. They also kept on lying that my modem was incompatible when it is clearly listed on Optimum supported modem websites - Optimum just wants to collect that extortive modem rental fee.

I cannot be the only one who brings their own modem from TWC to Optimum, so I hope this post helps someone.

\-----------

TLDR: When you bring your own modem from TWC to Optimum, you need to go into your router's configuration page, do a factory reset and then hook it up to Optimum (because TWC uses IPV6 and Optimum uses IPV4).",nyc

My night consisted of saving a pigeon with a broken wing,"I currently have a pigeon under my desk at work. Now you're probably thinking, ""What do you mean you have a pigeon under your desk?"" Well, allow me to explain.

Last night, I was walking around 93rd and Lex with my partner when he said, ""oh my God, that pigeon is still alive."" I looked, and there were two pigeons: one had very much been run over by a car, and the other one was sitting near the dead pigeon and clearly couldn't move--its wing was broken. ""Please, no,"" I hear you say. And my partner said the same. But yes, yes indeed.

So I called 311 and asked for animal control. The woman told me they weren't open until 8am tomorrow (today). And she said even if they were open, ""no they could NOT pick up the bird; the bird had to be brought in.""

My partner overheard this conversation, and he said, ""Jessica. No. I know that look.""

So I looked at him and said, ""either you're with me or you're against me. If you're not with me, then go back to the apartment without me. Otherwise, help me find a box or a paper bag."" (My apartment in is Bushwick for reference). So he ran off in search of something. He came back moments later with a plastic bag--because people in the upper east side are dumb and don't have paper bags. Granted, it was 10 at night, so most places were closed. So, I tore a bunch of holes in the bag, grabbed my gym shirt out of my bag, and picked up the pigeon with said shirt and placed him into said bag.

And so we had to traverse from 93rd street all the way down to the middle of Brooklyn--roughly a 55 minute commute. And, of course, this was by subway. And y'all know what's happening with the L line....

So I had to smuggle the pigeon while carrying him carefully in my hands through the subway station at 95th (my partner acted as a shield to get past the MTA folk), and I sat with the bird on my lap. This was all well and fine until we had to transfer to the L train at Union Square. The train last night was literally packed to the brim--I had to hold onto my partner while he gripped the ceiling. It was hell, to say the least, and I could feel the bird's heartbeat pounding the entire time. I'm not sure who was more anxious: the bird or myself.

So we finally arrived at my apartment at roughly 11pm, and I set up the bird (his name is Fred, by the way) in a cardboard box with paper towels as bedding and a shallow dish for water. My partner refused to let me keep him in the bedroom because ""Jess, birds are so dirty and have so many diseases. And think about how this affects me and Coco."" (Coco is my pet rabbit). But I couldn't keep him in the common space because my roommate has a cat. So, I placed the cardboard box with the bird on the roof of the apartment. I knew nothing would get him up there.

So I woke up today at 7am to bring Fred in. And I called the Animal Care Center again to make sure it's okay to bring him in. They told me they're actually not opening until 12pm today. And I'm thinking, ""Well, \*\*\*\*. I have to go to work, but I also have to get Fred to the ACC so they can help him."" And again my partner knows what I'm going to do, and he said, ""Jessica please God no."" And I said, ""oh, yes.""

So back on the subway we went--my partner, Fred, and myself. Fred was this time in a Trader Joe's paper bag. He was pretty chill and comfy. And a paper bag is much less conspicuous. 10/10 would recommend using a Trader Joe's bag to hide a pigeon.

So now, here I am at work with Fred under my desk in a Trader Joe's paper bag while I wait for the local ACC to open, during which time I will have to take the subway back up to 110th street from my office at 34th street.

Some of you will be laughing, some of you will be saying, ""you're clearly not from New York originally if you're saving a pigeon"" (and you would be correct in that). But that's my update. Here are pictures: [Adventures with Fred the Pigeon](https://imgur.com/a/RYcE1ua)

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: Fred is now in the care of Wild Bird Fund over on Columbus and 87th. There are a couple other pigeons there already, and the woman said he should make a good recovery. Big shoutout to MisanthropicScott for the suggestion!",nyc

Arts-Tech Summer Camp for NYC High Schoolers,"Hi everyone!

For any high schoolers still looking for something to do over the summer, [Eyebeam](https://www.eyebeam.org/) is running 2 sessions of an arts-technology intensive called [Digital Day Camp](https://www.eyebeam.org/digital-day-camp/). It is **completely beginner-friendly**, and we encourage people who have little experience to apply!

&amp;#x200B;

We pack our 2 week sessions with a **variety of workshops**, ranging from everything from motion capture and AR to lip reading. Our workshops are taught by professional artists and creative technologists, including our [artist residents](https://www.eyebeam.org/artists-3/)\--which means you'll have access to professionals breaking the boundaries between arts and STEM. We try to mix high- and low-tech, and provide a good introduction to a variety of tools--almost all of which are **open-source and free**, so you can continue learning on your own time at home.

&amp;#x200B;

The goal is not just to provide you with **technical skills**, but also to encourage **critical thinking** surrounding what technology means to you and how it impacts our lives. This year, we're focusing on the theme of **""access""**, and asking questions about who has access to what information, what prevents access, and what that means in our society.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interested, today is the LAST DAY to apply to Session 1, running from July 15-July 26.

We have rolling admissions for Session 2, July 29-August 9.

[**Apply here now!**](https://eyebeam.submittable.com/submit/137882/2019-digital-day-camp-open-call-for-students)

If you go to a school with **51% or more free or reduced price lunch,** it's **FREE** and you will receive a $100 stipend and MetroCard.

For other students interested, the program free is **$1000** for two weeks, including food, snacks, and more.

We will be located at SVA's campus near the Flatiron district!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: If you're a high schooler looking for something to do,** [apply to our arts-tech day camp](https://eyebeam.submittable.com/submit/137882/2019-digital-day-camp-open-call-for-students) **to get hands-on experiences with a variety of mediums and learn more about critical issues from professional artists.**

Landlord Wants Option to Show Apartment Every Day For Two Hours Without Individual Notice,"My girlfriend is entering the last month of her apartment lease.  She is not renewing.  Yesterday, she received an email from a broker, on behalf of the management company, stating that the broker will hold daily open houses of the available apartments in the building (including hers), for the following hours:

M-F 12-1:00 PM, 6:30-7:30 PM

Saturday: 2-3:30 PM

Sunday: 1-2 PM.

&amp;#x200B;

Neither the landlord nor broker will provide any further notice before people show up.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend really only has an issue with the 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM open houses, when she will be home. Thus, she responded and noted that, in New York, landlords may enter to show the apartment at reasonable hours and with appropriate notice.  She agreed to the noon open houses, and offered to allow 5:30 - 6:30 PM open houses and perhaps agree to more night open houses on an individual basis.

&amp;#x200B;

The landlord responded and claimed that they are in violation of a portion of the lease.  Sure enough, the lease says that, in the last 60 days on a tenancy, the renters will allow unfettered access from 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM daily, without further notice.  The stated penalty for noncompliance is that the landlord may withhold the security deposit.  This appears to be illegal under the law, but the landlord refuses to budge and it's been several rounds of emails now.

&amp;#x200B;

The landlord stated that it is their routine practice to show all of the units during the same windows, and refuses to adjust the time window for my girlfriend, or to show their units by appointment.  To me, this appears to be how they save on brokers' fees.

"Bway/Lafayette station today: upsetting scene, looking for follow up","Around 4pm today (Thursday) as I was exiting the Broadway-Lafayette BDFM station, I walked past a totally blissed out/passed out woman on the ground with a fucking \*baby\* strapped to her chest. I called 911 five minutes later when I got back to my office, gave very detailed information to EMS, and they assured me an ambulance was on the way. I \*did\* hear ambulance sirens not long after, but of course, you hear ambulances on Broadway not-infrequently.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I regret that I didn't stand there and wait to see that help arrived, or stand there to make sure nothing worse happened to that baby in the meantime. If there's a better subreddit for this kind of thing by all means tell me, but: did anyone happen to see this same pair or see EMS taking them out or talking to the woman? Or, are there resources to find out the results of a 911 call?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so emotional about the whole thing. In this neighborhood you see groups of people clearly-nodding-off-on-methadone every day, and subway stations often have women begging while holding babies, but this the baby was in SUCH a dangerous place, practically on the floor and strapped to someone unaware of its existence or safety.

EDIT WITH UPDATE: for anyone wondering, I went back to the station to see if they were still there. The newspaper the woman had been sitting on, a plastic bag with who knows what, and the half empty water bottle next to her were all in the same spot, but the woman and baby were gone. I may be grasping at straws but I have to think if she’d left on her own she’d have taken those things with her, so I am choosing to believe EMS did in fact arrive.",nyc

My friends birthday is this Saturday and we're taking a road trip to NY (leaving from Boston area). We're gonna spend all day there and I want to show her around.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now all I have planned is brunch and a trip to the museum of Natural History lol. So I definitely need to fill it out. It doesn't have to be just Manhattan we want to go around all the boroughs. So can you all recommenced some cheap things to do, sights to see, and places to eat? Nothing too touristy cause I bet we can't afford that. We will see the memorial and Times Square (M and M shop) and all that though.

Military clause in lease,"I am about to sign a one year lease in LIC, and I am a member of the military. In the lease it writes:

""MILITARY SERVICE
You represent that You are not in the military service or being supported by anyone in the
military service at this time. If during the tenancy You shall be supported by anyone in the
military service or You enter the military service, You must immediately notify Owner of this
change.""

I have noticed the landlord that this clause is not true and I'm reluctant to sign the lease unless the landlord changes the clause to acknowledge my military status. However, the landlord responded that the city draft the lease and he cannot change the lease. He acknowledge my military status in a email, and told me not to worry.

Is it true that the landlord (Rockrose) cannot change the lease? Am I protected by law (SCRA) to break the lease if I sign the lease and receive active duty order later?

I overheard a man threaten his child on the subway - is there anything I can do?,"I was on the Brooklyn R heading south, sitting next to a mom and her kid (around 7 or 8), with his dad standing next to them. I couldn't see the kid clearly, he was pretty well blocked by his mom, but it sounded like he was mildly acting up, like kicking a seat or something. After telling him to stop a few times, the father said, ""If you don't stop, it'll be the belt when we get home."" He sounded completely serious, and like it wasn't a new threat at all. The kid stopped after that. 

I wasn't sure what to do, though I took a couple of pictures. They got off at 4th and 9th; I'm not sure if that was their stop, or if they saw me. I called CPS and the local DV officer but there's really nothing they can do. Is there anything that can be done at all, or do I have to just hope it was a very deadpan joke?",nyc

Tolls by mail question,"I live in NJ and don't have EZPass.

While at a toll plaza in Queens  I went through a ""CASH"" lane but there was no collector or place to pay there (I think they have been done away with). A sign said ""All cash customers will be billed by Tolls by Mail"" or something to that effect.

I received an email the next  day (I was in the system from several years ago). It stated that two payments of $9.50 and a ""Violation"" of $15 were due.

We didn't know what to make of this and paid one of the $9.50 charges. (I went online just now and it says $9.50 plus $15 owed so that $9.50 payment has been processed.)

Today a ""Notice of Violation Enforcement Action"" arrived in the regular mail (it was mailed before the online payment) for $15. No mention of any other charges.

It said ""Since this is your first Notice of Violation, the administrative fee will be waived, provided the Toll is received within 15 days of the Notice Date"".

Anyone familier with how this works and who can give some pointers.

FM Radio stations,"Not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit but it’s the closest I’ve found and just wanted some other opinions. Before anyone says just use your phone and all that, I have a somewhat old car that doesn’t have a working AUX port. Anyways, the “hottest radio stations” have become bogged down by innumerable ads and constant gossip about celebrity news, to which I could give less of a flying fuck. On top of that, they only choose 4 or 5 popular songs and play that on repeat with one or two outliers (but still from top 40). The only decent radio stations are 97.1 (if you like hip-hop and rap) or 92.3 (if you like mainstream rock and alternative), but even then it’s not until after ~7:30 they play somewhat non-stop music with the only interruptions being promotions or concerts they’re having to raise money to avoid as many ads as other radio stations, which I respect.",nyc

I’m tired of officers parking their private vehicles wherever they want,"I live in The Bronx, and there’s barely any parking in my neighborhood as it is. There’s been construction since early February and we’ve have limited parking since then. 

After 2pm, if you haven’t found parking already, you’re in for a long wait, or have to park super far from where you usually do, if you choose to do so. 

Enter officers private vehicles...

These guys park in any “no parking anytime” section they can find and they get no tickets. They either have some orange reflective jacket folded up on the dashboard, a sign says they are NYPD affiliated or even has a court employee sign. No tickets given to them.

They even park in front of churches, no tickets. 

But let me put my car there for the night because I got home from work late and don’t want to spend $15 on a overnight parking lot, and I get hit with a $65 ticket. I parked in front of the church with the other private cars owned by NYPD, and they don’t get any tickets, but I do. 

This isn’t fair, parking is scarce as it is and NYPD thinks they can do whatever they want, yet we get the tickets? They don’t even play by the same rules as we do.

Whats the Eviction process for NYC,"Hi

I have a tenant who rents a floor in our private building. They are a month to month tenant. They paid first and last when they moved in. This is their last month and they are moving out, because they bought a house. Family of four but only three will be leaving. The forth came to us and said he will be staying and will not be able to pay rent. They have moved everything including the fridge they brought. Only left with one bed and a chair. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Three make a good living all work. They say they are having issues and have told the forth that he will not be leaving with them for months. I believe that's bullshit, because he was helping them move going over to clean up, and only until recently(\~1week ago) did they have a fight and he told us he was banned from moving with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My issues

It seems the three were never going to tell us about this situation. They left this man with nothing. He is old and retired 70+. I have asked if they could put him in senior care they didn't say a word. The old man told us we have to legally evict him as he has no were to go,  I say bullshit. The three are passing their problem onto us.

&amp;#x200B;

We had a good relationship they were good tenants. paid on time. They even told us they were happy that we would have the heat on at times their last place didn't. We also live in the building. Any problems we took care of. never raised the rent. It makes us sad and mad that they are doing this to us. We treated them with nothing but respect and now they are leaving us with their problems. We are honestly scared about the eviction process as i read the average is 6 months if not more, and that will be very painful for us.

&amp;#x200B;

I have issued the man a termination notice of 30 days. Not sure what the next steps are and the process of eviction. Is there a way to report this and help this man get some type of housing.

Film as a public resource is a critical part of New York’s culture and communities.

We are proud of the degree to which the New York community so strongly embraced Kanopy, and although we are disappointed by this decision, we understand that New York City’s libraries’ current priorities lie with other programs that also advance their mission. 

We are grateful for these libraries’ support of Kanopy for the past several years and we will continue to work with them to explore opportunities to partner again in the future. Until then, we hope we left you with an experience that enriched, inspired, and challenged your perspectives. 

Thank you for your patronage and support and we hope to connect with you again soon!

Capitalism is two parts: capital, and -ism. In other words, capitalism is about understanding the flows of capital. And capital, while mostly measured by dollars, also includes goods and services.

From a capitalist perspective, San Francisco is unaffordable because there's a lot of concentrated capital in one place, pushing up prices. This concentrated capital is mainly the tech industry, of which produces lots of value in the form of services, hence huge amounts of capital are being constantly created. And where value production occurs, banking also occurs, hence the bankers and mba's coming in as well.

Value production leads to price increases as it attracts capital in the form of money, and that in turn creates stimulus which then raises prices. For example, Uber produces value in the form of an innovative transit system, prices increase as Uber is an $80 billion company with employees receiving 6, 7, even 8 figures if you own enough stock. This huge amount of capital in a concentrated area raises prices, as this cohort has more expendable wealth and more potential revenue in taxes to the government. As this occurs, prices increase as value increases in the area.

The issue arrives when inequality happens. An economy cannot be just techies and bankers. Retail, construction, school, hospitals, tons of other industries also have to exist. But according to a capitalist system, value attracts capital, and the issue arrises when tech can produce value on a level of huge scale, and bankers produce absolutely no value to society other than reallocatting capital to those who work for a living, but since bankers are the ones controlling the flow of capital they inevitably get greedy and rake in billions for themselves, trillions when they get bailed out.

Point is, unless you're a banker or a techie, being in the epicenter of all that will not do you any favors. Capital, while attracted to value creation, also moves like water going downhill. As people get priced out and fed up, they move, stimulating areas which are cheap because they are lower with capital. Then when too many people move, capital stimulates the area, prices rise, and the cycle continues. This can work on a small scale of people moving to Oakland and commuting into SF, on a medium scale of people moving to Arizona for the low prices, or on an even larger scale of people moving to somewhere like Thailand where their money goes incredibly far. However you get what you pay for, and while relatively affordable, that's not where the innovation is going on.

Public policy is the only thing that can counter the forces of capitalism with regard to painful inequality. But government is deliberately bureaucratic and slow, and so while innovation strikes with speed and swiftness, regulators are always a mile behind playing a game of catchup. And that is why these crises continue on and we wonder why our elected officials don't seem to be doing anything about it.

Another issue is human ""stickiness"". People tend to stay where they grew up, and would rather live in misery than move, because they feel they have a right to live in the same area of their childhood. This then leads to a culture of anger, arrogance, and unabashed pride, while constantly lambasting change and transplants. And I don't blame them, if I was a local fighting tooth and nail struggling and suffering to stay where I grew up while witnessing constant change, growth, and rising prices, I'd be high strung all the time too.

San Francisco is becoming the West Coast's NYC, a great place to visit but not to live because it's so pricey. Which is fine, though if you go the way of NYC you will also inevitably gain a culture of ""if you can make it here you can make it anywhere"" and that's how hustle culture begins, a way of dealing with people where the bottom line is more valuable than your fellow man. But this probably won't happen to the scale of NYC, as NYC has Wall Street underpinning everything, while tech is more fluid and flexible and can grow in other areas around the Bay.

San Francisco's affordable days are long behind them, and that's a good thing, and if you are constantly feeling stressed it's probably because you're fighting against capitalist forces which reward large scale value production in the form of multi billion dollar technology startups, and the bankers, the ones with their greedy paws directing the flows of capital in the form of investing, banking, and underwriting businesses.

To end on a positive note, do not dismiss the scale of your economy. Things may be cheaper in other places, but that's because their economies are smaller, and when I say their economies are smaller I mean that there's less to do. Travel to the middle of the country and you can buy hundreds of acres for the price of a condo in downtown SF, but that's only because there's nothing going on in the middle of the country as compared to downtown SF. I have faith and optimism in the future of SF, because the value production here is like a spring of water, and even with outflows of capital in the form of people and maybe even businesses relocating, more and more capital is created, replacing the outflows and more, overall creating a positive impact for the city as a whole as well as the surrounding areas, as well as the entire country with these productions, inflows, as well as outflows of capital.",nyc
Penske Truck: Different location than drop-off?,"I'm attending grad school in a few weeks and need to start moving ASAP on a budget. Currently live in Brooklyn and going to school near Raleigh. Been looking into either renting an unlimited miles minivan at JFK or a Penske truck. Obvious advantages to the truck, but I never drove anything so big (thinking about driving that in Brooklyn gives me gas) and I can get 1/2 (and bulkiest) of my stuff in the van. However, it would be the sweetest option to just load everything into 1 truck (and grab misc. in my tiny car).

For the truck, I don't want to do a one-way move since I still need to bring my car (and a dolly is expensive + incredibly cumbersome to setup/drive in the city) and it's a PITA to grab a bus back to NYC from North Carolina (no direct bus). So, I was thinking of dropping off the truck in Washington DC instead. Plenty of bus/trains that go direct to NYC and a lot shorter ride back home.

My concern though is, although the truck is unlimited miles, there are different rates between dropping off in DC and Raleigh (almost double the cost). So even though they advertise 'unlimited miles', it seems to be under the assumption of the number of miles I would be driving. Is that a valid concern to have? Do they monitor your miles and/or have a GPS tracker?",nyc

LES/CB3 residents: De Blasios planned demolition of the east river park to be voted on June 25th by the CB3.,"De Blasio is planning on closing the East River park for 4 to 10 years to protect the area against storm surges at the cost of 1.5 billion. The previous proposal building a seawall was only 750 million and did not close the newly renovated park for this long.


The park just had a renovation that the community fought for years to get. Now it will be closed again, likely for a decade from Grand to 23rd st. They plan to demolish a historic amphitheater, pedestrian bridges and other structures in addition to nearly every tree from Grand to 23rd st.


If you're concerned over the cost and time frame of this project and its impacts on residents who use the park daily please come out and voice your opinion this tuesday at 166 essex st at 6:30pm.

It's giving me a lot of guilt, like I'm not ""doing NYC right"" by being a hypebeast in the LES or going to glorious events and summer parties every weekend.
