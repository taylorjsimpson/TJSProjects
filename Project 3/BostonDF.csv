Gentle reminder that the first wave of raids starts on Sunday,"Edit: Update from /u/NumberWrangler

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We now know that ICE has planned mass arrests for this weekend and likely into next week. These ARE NOT GENERAL RAIDS. They will not be random.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://twitter.com/matt\_cam/status/1142287113792172033](https://twitter.com/matt_cam/status/1142287113792172033)  
&gt;  
&gt;The intended targets (and their legal advocates) have reason to know who they are:  
&gt;  
&gt;\--Anyone who has missed an immigration court date or  
&gt;  
&gt;\--Has received a final order of removal, from an immigration judge or at the border  
&gt;  
&gt;\--Anyone living in their homes.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's all. That's it

\-------------------

Original post:

Gentle reminder that the first wave of [raids](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/11/ice-raids-round-up-immigrants-deportation-sunday-nyt-reports/1701549001/) starts on Sunday. While the total target count is one million individuals, the first wave should only grab a few thousand people (mainly [families](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/trump-immigrant-illegal-undocumented-raids-ice.html)).

Still, this is the first wave of a massive national operation so there are bound to be mistakes. They already nabbed one of my friend's grandparents since he was the only Latino in a crowd. He was a US citizen, but didn't have his passport on him and was taken away for a little while on account of his inability to prove it.

That brings me to the point of this post. If you fit a profile to be hit as a target of opportunity (which is encouraged with this Sunday's raid, according to some news sources) and live in a section of the city that may have illegals near it remember to...

1. Keep your documents on you to prove you are legally here
2. Make sure your friends and family have an electronic copy of your documents on the cloud that are easily accessible

For those wondering how these work raids, here's a quote from a friend of mine in the DC area:

&gt;Raids like this have happened in my neighborhood at least twice now. They just detain anybody on the street who they ‚Äúsuspect.‚Äù

This isn't a reason to panic, but if you think you may be wrongly targeted this Sunday, a little preparation can save a whole lot of headache.

Advice For Handling This Landlord Situation?,"Long term lurker but first time posting! appreciate any advice you have on how youd handle the situation.

currently live in a 2 bed apt and we're on the 9/1 cycle. property management company reached out about us renewing for another year. i am definitely staying and let them know. my buddy in the 2nd room is currently interviewing for a new gig that would take him to nyc if he gets it and accepts. he is happy with his job here in boston and isn't otherwise applying anywhere else aside from this one. he has his final interview sometime next week so he will know soon what his plans are.

if he decides to move to nyc, i would find a new roommate to take his place on new lease. like lots of people i've done this in the past when roommates have left and its not been an issue. with the high turnover for 9/1 i feel pretty confident that it wouldnt be a problem to find someone if needed.

issue is that we've explained this to the property manager and he's been difficult. property manager is new to the company and this is our first time interacting with him. our old property manager doesnt work there anymore so we dont have any other contacts to reach out to. 

i have already signed the renewal. my buddy hasnt and wants to hold off until he knows for sure. might be overly cautious, but he doesnt want this new property manager to try to pull something like deny a replacement roommate if he and i both signed the renewal.

i dont think either of us has been unreasonable but the new property manager has been a bit of an ass. not sure if he's just trying to put the pressure on, but he's mentioned allowing brokers to show it if we both don't sign asap. like i said i am committed to staying and plan to show the apt to new roommates as backup if current roommate leaves.

how would you handle if in my situation? any advice i might not be thinking of? we're waiting to hear back to have him confirm it won't be an issue if a roommate swap needs to happen if my roommate signs and then we find out next week he's leaving. obviously getting everything in writing. i know housing can move off the market quickly in boston (port city afterall) and would hate to have someone apply quickly if they start showings in the next couple days before we know whats up/before id have a backup tenant in place. 

sorry so long! trying to provide all details. anyone dealt with this before?",boston

Has anyone applied for a state job through the Massachusetts online portal?,"Asking as I applied for a bunch of state jobs recently.

However - does that even help my case? When I edit an application, does it resubmit it or does it stay at the bottom of the pile from when I first applied? I'm afraid the HR people already viewed my applications and disregarded them, since they became incomplete when I deleted my cover letters.",boston

Curious if our crummy apartment building violates fire regulations in Boston. It‚Äôs Samia.,"There was some sort of fire in our building tonight, but I almost slept through it. None of our fire alarms went off, only hallway ones. It was faint enough from the bedroom that I would have ignored it if my boyfriend hadn‚Äôt come in and said he thought we should leave.

Our building has 3 floors not counting the basement and no fire escape. We got out our apartment and the hallway was smoky, so we got to the closest stairwell and found it even smokier. It turns out the smoke source was coming from the basement, and as we started down I realized the smoke was getting thicker the further we went. Three flights of stairs through smoke getting worse the closer we got to the exit. it wasn‚Äôt an issue this time, but i realized if we had gotten out later or the smoke had been worse, we would have had a major issue.

I‚Äôve been saying since we moved in that we should get one of those collapsible window ladders, and now seeing how difficult it could be to get out during a fire I‚Äôm thinking we need it even more. I may be paranoid but I‚Äôm questioning the fire safety of this building (god knows they drop the ball on managing it). Does it violate any fire regulations?

tl;dr: Samia companies building is not well set up for fire evacuation, wondering if there‚Äôs anyone I can talk to",boston
Traveling to Beverly/Salem,"Hi all! I'm visiting Beverly for the weekend and arriving tomorrow morning. I've never taken public transit in/around Boston, and had a few questions!

Quite the warm welcome!,"Hello people of Boston! I thought I would share a recent heartwarming story that really made me feel welcome in this city. After driving for three consecutive days in a move from Kansas City, I finally arrived to Boston just in time to celebrate the Fourth of July. After a stressful and rushed move in process, all I wanted was to see this historical city on the Fourth albeit alone (it‚Äôs hard to make friends in a brand new city!). I was waiting for the bus in Brighton to go see the reading of the Declaration of Independence when I left my wallet at the bus stop. I assumed that in a big east coast city, no one would return my wallet and that my holiday would basically suck. However, within ten minutes, a saintly Bostonian messaged me on Facebook, paid for her own Lyft to meet me, and returned my wallet to me. And she wouldn‚Äôt even let me pay her back! Needless to say, I had a wonderful Fourth of July and now have a very positive opinion of Bostonians. Thank you kind stranger, and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of this city!

TL;DR I just moved to Boston and love it in part because a stranger returned my wallet to me and allowed me to have a wonderful Fourth of July!",boston

MGH: Negative Experience So Far,"Hello all,

I would appreciate your perspective with my experience onboarding as a new patient at MGH. 

1) My new doctor at MGH has stated a five month wait time for a physical. Is this to be expected, or does that seem unreasonable to you?

2) I have been trying for two weeks to talk directly to a human at the Bressler Clinic (Adult ADHD prescription request) but we keep having to communicate through their voicemail system. It takes them days to respond and I really just want to schedule an evaluation.

For #2, does anyone have a doctor they would recommend in Boston that is responsive? I believe I know what I need and don‚Äôt require a full evaluation (which sounds expensive). I don‚Äôt think this requires me to use MGH and at this point it‚Äôs simply taking too long.

How do I make supportive friends?,"Ive been in Boston for about 4yrs and I‚Äôve had a hard time finding and building a strong and supportive network of friends.

I also suffer from clinical depression. Ive been going to therapy for 2yrs and recently started antidepressants and I have definitely seen improvement in my mood and attitude. 

I do put myself out there. I‚Äôve gone to meet and greets, networking events and found a girls facebook group that has fun local events.

Boston rent slumlord advice,"We've been renting an apartment from a property company in Boston since 2018.

After several follow-ups and ""we'll do it next week"" which never happened, we decided to withhold rent.

Now they are threatening to evict us for not paying half of July's rent, and we already have last month in August paid for up front. I feel like slumlords are quite common in a renters situation, any advice? Can they really evict us when we technically have 45 days more rent paid?

Tourist looking for opinions for late September travel: Cape Cod,"Hi everyone! I live in Cleveland and my husband and I are trying to plan a long weekend at the end of September (thinking 9/25-9/30).

We will likely get in late on the 25th so we were considering staying downtown that night then taking the ferry over to Provincetown the following day.

Dog owners of Boston...how do you do it?,"I‚Äôve been a Boston (specifically Allston) resident for 10 years. I‚Äôve been dabbling with the idea of getting a dog with my fianc√© for a while now. 

1) If you work full time, what is your preferred method of entertaining the dog during the day?  Wag?  Doggy daycare?

2) I‚Äôve lived in many places and all have said No Dogs on the lease.  Do you just ignore that?  Or are people actually living with dogs allowed on their lease?

Edit: I find it hard to believe every dog owner I‚Äôve seen in the Boston area has a dogs allowed lease. Most places in my neck of the woods have a strict policy and most landlords dont care even if you talk to them.

keep renting or buy in Cambridge/Somerville,"I cannot decide what to do:  
I currently rent a 1 br apartment for $2150/mo on the Cambridge/Somerville border. I just put an offer in on a condo and am now second guessing the decision to buy. I know that you can't time either the stock market or the real estate market, but I guess I just want a gut check if possible.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Details:  
I love my current apartment -- it's the right amount of space for me, and the location is fantastic. I've been here for a year, have a month-to-month lease, and a great landlady who mentioned that she has never raised the rent on a tennant once they have moved in.  
&amp;nbsp;  
The condo is essentially the same as what I currently rent. Same location, same SF, less storage space (which I will miss), better appliances/finishes. It is new construction.  
&amp;nbsp;  
The issue is: my monthly cost for the condo will be $900-950 more per month than what I pay now for rent. This is with a 7/1 ARM, inclusive of HOA, insurance, 20% down payment, etc. I feel like the condo is a very good option if I *had* to buy something right now, but...I do not, and I could put this $900/month (and all of the money that I would not be using for a down payment/closing costs) into the market, and stay in my current apartment for another five years.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Over the past year, my monthly take-home income has been used in the following way:  
* 34.7% rent  
* 9.5% car payment + insurance + renters insurance (1.3 years left on car payment)  
* 25.2% misc spending (utilities, groceries, eating out, travel, gym membership, clothes, etc.)  
* 30.7% savings  
&amp;nbsp;  
During this time I had the unusual expenses of moving and furnishing my new apartment. Otherwise expenses were normal, but I am very frugal. (Single, no kids -- the latter part of that is not changing.)  
&amp;nbsp;  
If I were to purchase the condo, that takes the allocation to the following:  
* 48.3% housing  
* 17.1% savings   
&amp;nbsp;  
I have used the NYT calculator and it is very contingent on what happens to home values, and what happens in the market. I do not think that the Boston real estate market will tank in the next 5-6 yrs, but the stock market might. I have no real reason to move -- it was mostly just that I had saved enough money for a down payment and I love living in this area and wanted the security of being able to continue to do that.",boston

Missed connection with Boston girl,"I know this is a long shot, but I've seen crazier things happen on the internet.

I met this girl from Boston at a bar in Asbury Park, NJ on Friday night (7/5). I was ordering drinks at the bar at Johnny Mac's when the bartender asked me what I wanted even though you were there longer. You wasted no time in letting her know the error of her ways, and I was in no position to argue with a woman so determined to be served. 

You weren't going to take the water that you ordered because it was overpriced. I mean, honestly, who doesn't give out tap water at a bar? We got to talking about how they don't do that in Boston, and I mentioned that I was headed up there later this month to get my ""SHAAHHK"" tattoo up near seaport. You told me how nice that area was and even suggested a few places to go. 

Unfortunately, I completely dropped the ball when I already had my phone out looking up the tattoo parlour for you to actually get your name or number. I spent most of my remaining time at the bar trying to find you, but that place was a mess. I was, obviously, unsuccessful. 

If anyone knows someone or had friends travel to NJ for the weekend, I'd really appreciate it if you could pass the word around. Like I said, I'm not banking on this actually working. But if it somehow does, I'd love to take her out for some food/drinks on 7/17-7/21 when I'm up there. She was a brunette, about 5'4""(?), with a little nose ring. 

Also, wouldn't this make one hell of a ""how we met"" story if this actually works??",boston

Moving to Boston guidance,"Hello everyome. First of all, if this isnt allowed,  please delete. Secondly, im posting this for.a friend. Said friend is moving to Boston in a few days and is having absolute hell finding a place to live. Shes in the navy and is PCSing from san diego. Her problem with moving is that the leasing requirements are completely different from california and she wants to make sure she isnt getting fucked around because she is an outsider and doesnt know any better.

   She has been told that there is a locator fee on every lease upward of $1000, and also that she cant apply to most places until the 1st and the 15th of the month, which being on such a time sensetive schedule, leaves her without a home and wasting money on hotels for a week. Also, a lot of leasing agencies are telling her that in order to hold an apartment, she needs to place a full months rent which isnt guaranteed back if she ends up not wanting the place. 

  Finding a place to live is hard enough, but doing it remotely is even worse, with not being able to see the place before you make a commitment to it. If anyone has any tips to make her move slightly easier, we would greatly appreciate any input.

Crazy animal noises at night in the summer near JP/Brookline.,"Occasionally, I hear these insane animal noises at night in the woods/field behind my house. There is a softer kind of whimpering sound that is then accompanied by a really loud screaming that sounds like a tape player on super fast forward. It is so loud that you can hear all of the forest reverberation. 

I moved here in spring of 2018 and have heard it both summers that I‚Äôve lived here.  I used to stay up really late last summer so I heard it 4 or 5 times and this summer I have been going to bed earlier so I‚Äôve only heard it once, but it seems to happen in the middle of the night. Does anyone have any idea what kind of animal is making that noise or what is happening?",boston
Best Credit Union/Bank?,"Hi there,

I recently moved to Cambridge just about a week ago. I currently use Citibank, but learned that they no longer have any branches in the Greater Boston area. While my experience with Citi has not been bad, I do feel like this is a good opportunity to look into my options for better bang-for-my-buck financially, as well as improved convenience in my new residence.

I am considering switching to a new bank/credit union, but don't really know what the overall best is, living here. Things that I value:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Good customer service, convenient features, good security

\- Wide spread free ATMs available, or at least refunds on ATM fees

\- Currently have very low interest rates, but would appreciate a bank with higher rates.

\- Decent online/mobile banking

&amp;#x200B;

I've never used a credit union before and learned my current employer uses Metro Credit Union. I was considering this, however have heard from people that DCU is superior. The downside to DCU is there are no nearby physical branches.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering what your general feel on the topic is?",boston

Anyway, I have received some decent offers coming from Boston and have been considering looking into some of them.

I have also been receiving offers from the New Orleans area, so if anyone has any input for that location as well it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Problem with rats,"Hi everyone,  


I'm originally from Chile and I moved to Somerville more than 1 year ago.  


In the multi-family building apartment that I live in, there's a parking lot with a big dumpster, the problem that I have is that every day I see at least one or two rats going on it and running from me when I'm taking out the garbage or getting into my car.  


In Chile rats are dangerous because they transmit hantavirus, so if you see a rat you're not going to rest until you kill it, your whole family will join forces to kill that son of a bitch, but here in my building, my neighbors don't seem to care at all, I've asked my landlord many times to do something and... he doesn't do anything.  


I've seen traps in the parking lot, but... they are already full of rats and I haven't seen anyone changing them for new ones.  


Is this normal in the US/Boston? I've seen rats in other places, TD garden is full of them but that's a construction site, so I guess that's ""normal"", aren't they dangerous in here? if you tell that they're just ugly then I don't really care about them, I just don't want anyone in my family to get sick, specially my 10 month old son.  
What should I do? can I call the City Hall or someone to pass a fine to my landlord, maybe that way he'll do something about it.",boston

Weird technical question about Downtown Crossing and Bluetooth,"Ok, this is going to sound nuts, but bear with me.  I work in Beacon Hill, and I take the Orange Line home.  I walk down Beacon Street towards Downtown Crossing, cross over Tremont to School Street, and walk down to the State Street stop.  Without fail, whenever I walk between Tremont and Washington, my Bluetooth headset experiences a lot of interference.  It happens every day, and always in that same area and it immediately clears up once I'm across Washington Street.

Question about parking permits when I move to Boston,"So I‚Äôm moving to Boston from Delaware for a job soon and something I just realized is I need to consider what I‚Äôm going to do for parking. I literally JUST got my car inspected and tagged for another year for Delaware. 

But it seems that MA needs you to be tagged for MA to get a resident parking tag there? And if my dad is the technical insurance holder and owner for the car (there are reasons why he‚Äôs the best person to have his name on it) can I even get the car tagged in MA without him? 

I need to move up there so I was just going to drive the car up there but if I can‚Äôt even get parking for it, I‚Äôm unsure of what to do for the moment.

Edit: bonus question, what if I just uhauled my stuff there and went without a car in Boston? How fucked would I be with how the MBTA is currently",boston

Are renting application and credit check charges legal in Boston?,"Sorry if this is a stupid (and long) question, but I'm a new renter in Boston and am in contact with Boston's Best regarding an apartment I'm trying to sign a lease for. 

I was put into contact with Boston's Best Realty via my future roommates. Boston's Best is asking for $20 for the Rental Application and $20 for a Guarantor's Application, which I guess pays for the cost to run the reports? 

My question is whether or not that's legal. Based on 940 CMR 3.00 Section 3.17 (4)(a) from the Office of the Attorney General, which says:

&gt;(4) Security Deposits and Rent in Advance. It shall be an unfair or deceptive practice for an owner to:   
&gt;  
&gt;(a) require a tenant or prospective tenant, at or prior to the commencement of any tenancy, to pay any amount in excess of the following:   
&gt;  
&gt;1. rent for the first full month of occupancy; and   
&gt;  
&gt;2. rent for the last full month of occupancy calculated at the same rate as the first month; and   
&gt;  
&gt;3. a security deposit equal to the first month's rent; and,   
&gt;  
&gt;4. the purchase and installation cost for a key and lock.  or, at any time subsequent to the commencement of a tenancy, demand rent in advance  in excess of the current month's rent or a security deposit in excess of the amount allowed  by 940 CMR 3.17(4)(a)3.  

It sounds like they can't charge for those applications. 

However, in reading [this post](https://masslandlords.net/can-massachusetts-landlords-charge-an-application-fee/) on [MassLandlords.net](https://MassLandlords.net), it sounds like *Brokers* ***can*** charge for these applications. But I can't tell whether or not Boston's Best Realty are brokers or agents.

So I ran the Charles River path today - a few thoughts,"Did a 15 mile double loop from the Museum out to Western Ave.  They are doing all kinds of work for the 4th, and the area before and after the Hatch is a kind of a shit show.  Cars parked everywhere, cars &amp; trucks fucking DRIVING everywhere.  I was almost taken out by a coke truck near the Fielder pedestrian bridge.  (These fuckers really should stop their vehicles when on the path until walkers/bikers/runners are clear.)

Around 10:30am or so I came upon the aftermath of a really bad bike accident at the S curve under the Kenmore ramp (where the mural is.)  Cops and EMS were on the scene, looked like a woman had a very serious head injury - they loaded her on a stretcher and were rolling with lights and sirens out of there.

DCR has been doing a nice job with mowing, trimming trees, painting benches and the like for the 4th, but after I saw the accident, I was thinking they should put up some signs.  Based on my significant time down there, it may help to have:

""Keep right""

""share the path &amp; be aware of your surroundings""

""be kind and don't hog the path""  (or something to that effect)

""Dog owners with retractable leashes that are oblivious to creating a trip line across the entire path will be thrown into the river by the angry bald runner""

Just got a job in Boston. I live near Providence. Wondering about commute.,"So, I just got an awesome job offer in Boston that I really don‚Äôt wanna turn down, but I live in Rhode Island near Providence. West Cranston to be specific. 

I was planning on driving into Providence and then taking the train to the Landmark Center Concourse building. But I just saw that a monthly MBTA pass is about $370 dollars.

I could also drive all the way to work. Waze tells me it takes about an hour without rush hour traffic. But with traffic, it could take 2 and a half hours. 

FYI I just graduated college and have no knowledge of the working world of the city yet. 

Any one else on the sub experience a similar commute situation? And what was your best solution?

Last night at 1am I was coming back from downtown and went to the Bunker Hill Monument to smoke a vape pen with my brother. We walked around the back of the monument and saw about 20+ guys in black polo shirts standing in formation. It was about 4 rows each of about 5-7 guys standing on the backside of the monument (behind it, away from the city view) and a guy at the front was holding a huge American flag on a pole. 

My brother saw it first and told me that I had to walk up the hill and see this, when I walked over they must have heard us because they were all staring in my direction. We both booked it out of there. 

The guys were probably all 20-40 years old, all white, and wearing black polo shirts. So f'n creepy. What do you think this could have been??",boston

?! Cat in boston: giving away advice!,"Hello everyone.

This is my first reddit post ever even though I've used it for years, I'm kinda upset that my first post is such a sad and hard one but I really need your help.

International college student, currently studying in Boston. 

When I first moved in, my friend and I decided to adopt a cat. At first the plan was that we would both take care of her physically and financially but she would only be living at my place so that she doesn't get upset and confused by having to move from house to house whenever we felt like it. Also, I have had cats my whole life when I was living with my family so I know how to care for them.

We adopted her from this middle eastern guy that was graduating and didn't want her anymore. She was 8 months old. He told us that she had some skin condition but we were too excited to care and just took her in immediately.

You know the drill: the litter, picky food, fur everywhere. Keep in mind I moved into a really nice place (a studio) that was spotless when I first moved in. 

I dealt with it. She peed in my bag once but that was the only really annoying thing she did. I wasn't upset because I knew she was young and afraid etc.

Vet visits begin: I don't want to go into too much detail but basically she's VERY sick. As in she has multiple things going on. Some allergy or immune system condition that makes her scratch herself to the point she's raw (which the vet's couldn't diagnose). And now just found out she has severe stomatitis which means the poor thing has major discomfort when she eats (hurts her mouth a lot and also makes a really big mess now when she tries to. Also had to try out many different foods to see which she seems more comfortable with.) 

After realizing my friend isn't a huge cat person, we just decided that she would be mine. Meaning I'd care for her, and support her in every way (including financially).

Vet visits were VERY expensive. In the last 5 months, I've spent approximately: $1000+ just on check ups and tests etc. 

I kind of broke down every time we had to go to the vet but I thought it's worth it to care for her because she's so cute and precious.


Going back home in the summer: cat sitter wants $750 + food and litter expenses to take care of her for 2 months in the cat sitter's own home. 

I saved up in order to be able to do this.

I am getting very frustrated.

I'm getting frustrated with her illnesses. The vets costing so much. How picky she is with her food and having so so many cans laying around that she won't even touch. The fur. Cleaning every part of my apartment every single day. 

Today, at 3:30am, she shat on my carpet. 

This was it for me. I broke down, couldn't stop crying and couldn't figure out what to do.

I know you need to have huge patience with pets which I think I'm not horrible at. And I know her shitting on my carpet isn't a big deal. But this was kind of the breaking point for me after everything. 

P.S. remember I'm a college student and have 1000 other things to deal with.

I understand that I sound like a bi***. But it's 4am and I really need your help. 

I have two options:

1. Give her away before I go back home in a week.

2. Wait till the end of this year and find a way to take her to my home country (Kuwait) and have her live in my parents house (my parents suggested this.)

I'm open to ANYTHING. ANY criticism. Tell me everything you guys are thinking.

If you read through this whole thing, I can't thank you enough.",boston

Best place to watch US soccer game before flight home,"I know I know...check the sidebar. But my situation is a little unique and I'm hoping for some local knowledge/kindness.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, told my boss/team that I have a 3:30 flight home today, but it's really not till 6:15, so I'm hoping to go somewhere to watch the US Soccer game at 3. Given the flight time, I would need it to be close to the airport, either through Uber or through the T. Last time I spent the afternoon downtown, figured I was a 5 minute Uber from the airport, then sat in the tunnel for 30 minutes...trying to avoid that, especially on a Friday afternoon. I'm from Chicago, so should be able to manage taking the train, just no concept of the routes/schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at East Boston and saw Mavericks Marketplace as an option, but not much else. Am I missing anything over there? Or else I assume something close to the train that could get me to the airport in under 20 minutes or so.

Boston parking meter rates to increase on July 1,"From MassLive:

Those traveling into Boston can expect to pay more to park at meters and ride the MBTA starting on July 1.

The city of Boston will increase parking meter rates in some neighborhoods on July 1, a measure the city says is part of a wider effort to reduce congestion, increase parking availability and reinvest in transportation infrastructure.

The office of the parking clerk said the revised fees are the result of a two-year pilot program in Back Bay and South Boston. Meter costs will double in some neighborhoods when the new rates go into effect on the first of July. The MBTA will hike its ridership fares on the same date.

Here is a list of the new parking rates in different Boston neighborhoods starting July 1, courtesy Boston‚Äôs [office of the parking clerk](https://www.boston.gov/departments/parking-clerk/how-do-parking-meters-work):

* **Back Bay**: $3.75 per hour
* **Bulfinch Triangle**: $2.50 per hour in the area bordered by Causeway Street, Lomasney Way, Staniford Street, Merrimac Street, New Chardon Street, and North Washington Street.
* **Fenway/Kenmore**: $2.50 per hour
* **South Boston Waterfront**: $3.75 per hour on all city-owned streets, with the exception of D Street, which will be priced at $2.50 per hour.
* **Motorcycle parking**: $0.50 per hour at all parking stalls. These include those located on Milk Street, Pearl Street, High Street, Batterymarch Street, Newbury Street, Exeter Street, Gloucester Street, Boylston Street, and Fairfield Street.
* Parking meter rates in **all other metered areas** of the city, including Beacon Hill, the Financial District, and the South End, will be set to $2 per hour.",boston

Apartment hunting is a hot mess, but I have found a few nice options in Cambridge. As far as I can see the only way to get from Cambridge to BU is via buses, so I'd appreciate any thoughts on use of the bus system in Boston. From what I've read it sounds like it's...not great, but tell me why. Runs late? Always full? Not reliable? Or - in a best case scenario - is it totally fine and there are just minor things that are frustrating?

Moved to DC from Boston shortly after the beginning of the new year. Feeling homesick. Tell me why I should be glad I left Boston.,"I grew up in Boston, right in Allston-Brighton, where me and my sister were the only kids playing in the street, surrounded by yuppies, college students, and empty-nesters. Spent 27 years here. Never thought about leaving really.

Then I got a job offer I couldn't refuse, so I moved to DC for it.

Lately, I've been feeling homesick. DC is okay but it's the most generic city I've ever been in. It's no New York or San Francisco for sure. There's no character here, most people work for the government or some non-profit or is in graduate school, biding for their time to move on when the time is right. I don't care about mumbo sauce. DC does brunch and happy hour well but brunch and happy hour are just excuses to hang out with people. The summers are hot and humid, and they just started.

But I digress. Tell me why I should be glad I moved away from Boston, /r/boston.",boston

Favorite spots for dining alone?,"Any recommendations for places that are particularly good for those dining alone? I'm interested in places where I'd be happy alone at a table or a bar. I'm staying near the convention center but expect I'll have to do at least some traveling to find the right sorts of places. I'm comfortable taking the train or an Uber.

I'm in my 30s and like South and Central American (as Peruvian, Costa Rican, Brazilian, and Venezuelan food, not those regions of the U.S.) best, but recognize this may not be the best city for those interests. I'm from the Detroit area and frequently visit Chicago, so not too interested in specialties from those cities. No dietary restrictions, but I don't drink alcohol very often, though I'm open to having a drink with dinner at the right place. Budget is fairly open as well, probably looking for places under $35 per meal but would go higher for the right place. 

I'll be in town on a July Wednesday-Saturday for a conference (on my own for dinner those nights), and staying a few days to explore (though I'll be joined my sister for that part).  

I've searched, but I haven't been able to find a relevant thread specifically for those dining solo. 

Edit- adding that I'm near the convention center at Summer and D Street, not Hynes.

Thanks!",boston

"My house is a bus stop, how do I tactfully encourage the nice people waiting for the bus keep trash and cigarette butts off my lawn?","My 2 family house IS a bus stop.   The bus stops right at my front door, and people will often be sitting my houses front steps, leaving garbage there, or leaving cigarette butts  (maybe 30 or 40 a day) all over my house, bushes, yard fence.  When I bought it a while ago, I always knew it would be a bit busy out front, but the secondary problem of it being full of garbage all the time ha's gotten to be a little too much lately.   


My first gut reaction (which I know to always be incorrect...) is to put a bunch of rude and angry signs in all capitals NO SMOKING etc etc.  I know that this just won't get the right type of attention, nor ultimately help with the problem.  I'm trying to avoid the aggressive/jerky type solution.  


My house has a stoop stairway that goes downwards from my front door, and terminates right at the street's sidewalk.    People often sit IN my stairway, and it's actually kind of dangerous if i'm running down the stairway and they are sitting there.  I've run into people a few times.    


Left and right of my stairway there are  two little raised cement block landscaping sections a couple feet off the ground with a couple bushes in them. People often sit in/next to the bushes, and often the bushes accumulate the people's typical city garbage from cigg butts, newspapers, Dunkin cups, hypodermic needles...  I'd just like to have the trash accumulate somewhere else I suppose....  


I'm trying to think of a creative solution that will be much more constructive.  A 'good neighbor' solution.  Maybe I give them a proverbial ash tray or somewhere to put the trash? I still don't know....  


Any ideas from other well-meaning idea dreameruppers would be appreciated.",boston

Cambridge's Sullivan Courthouse battle - what do you think?,"I went to the community meeting at the Kennedy Longfellow school this past Wednesday to hear the results of the parking study for the Sullivan Courthouse. The study suggested parking would not be impacted in the area - but it's clear to me this is a red herring issue, and whatever the result, people will support it or not solely based upon their POV around the Courthouse. I am very strongly in favor of the proposal, and would like to see work begin on it very soon. It was clear that the audience was fairly split, with more people opposed to the Courthouse than not. I'd be curious to hear from people that did NOT attend, because I believe community groups are drowning out people who support the project.

My POV is this building is never in a million years being torn down, and the longer we wait, the more issues will happen with the zombie building. I also think the ECPT (East Cambridge Planning Team) is making the issue a million times worse with disinformation and bullying tactics. There was a moment where an elderly resident was speaking in favor of the building, and the opposition started laughing at him. Laughing at this poor man! I'm not saying it was the ECPT specifically, but this is a group that laughed about someone verbally assaulting an employee of Leggat McCall (the developer) in a storefront they've put up on Cambridge Street. 

Anyway, I'd love to hear people's thoughts on the Sullivan Courthouse project, and if they favor the renovation proposal or not.",boston

Health Insurance - Allways Partners?,"Quick question about insurance providers in MA. I have access to Harvard Pilgrim and Allways Health Partners. The coverage seems almost identical after looking at the information provided to me from my employer ( copays, prescription costs, ER visit costs, etc etc). 

The question then becomes how good are the networks for these insurance providers. I know Harvard Pilgrim is top tier and is covered nearly everywhere. Allways seems to be in network for all of my current healthcare needs, but how does it compare overall? Has anyone had issues with specialists not being in network with Allways? 

I would have to pay about another $30 per month if I opt for Harvard Pilgrim over Allways, which is about $360 per year. Which is not a TON, but is definitely not negligible. I've had Harvard Pilgrim through my parents in the past and it has been great. I know Allways is Partners (MGH, BWH) and so should be accepted there.

Gentle reminder that the first wave of raids starts on Sunday,"Edit: Update from /u/NumberWrangler

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We now know that ICE has planned mass arrests for this weekend and likely into next week. These ARE NOT GENERAL RAIDS. They will not be random.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://twitter.com/matt\_cam/status/1142287113792172033](https://twitter.com/matt_cam/status/1142287113792172033)  
&gt;  
&gt;The intended targets (and their legal advocates) have reason to know who they are:  
&gt;  
&gt;\--Anyone who has missed an immigration court date or  
&gt;  
&gt;\--Has received a final order of removal, from an immigration judge or at the border  
&gt;  
&gt;\--Anyone living in their homes.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's all. That's it

\-------------------

Original post:

Gentle reminder that the first wave of [raids](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/11/ice-raids-round-up-immigrants-deportation-sunday-nyt-reports/1701549001/) starts on Sunday. While the total target count is one million individuals, the first wave should only grab a few thousand people (mainly [families](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/trump-immigrant-illegal-undocumented-raids-ice.html)).

Still, this is the first wave of a massive national operation so there are bound to be mistakes. They already nabbed one of my friend's grandparents since he was the only Latino in a crowd. He was a US citizen, but didn't have his passport on him and was taken away for a little while on account of his inability to prove it.

That brings me to the point of this post. If you fit a profile to be hit as a target of opportunity (which is encouraged with this Sunday's raid, according to some news sources) and live in a section of the city that may have illegals near it remember to...

1. Keep your documents on you to prove you are legally here
2. Make sure your friends and family have an electronic copy of your documents on the cloud that are easily accessible

For those wondering how these work raids, here's a quote from a friend of mine in the DC area:

&gt;Raids like this have happened in my neighborhood at least twice now. They just detain anybody on the street who they ‚Äúsuspect.‚Äù

This isn't a reason to panic, but if you think you may be wrongly targeted this Sunday, a little preparation can save a whole lot of headache.
